// how to create a heading using jsx
// jsx is not html in js , they are different . they are like html-like syntax

    Namaste react using jsx
    </h1>); // if you writng jsx in multiple lines it's mandotary to use wrap it
// lets see what jsxheading is really ...
console.log(jsxHeading);
// jsx is not understandable by browser so it's not js. but still it is getting rendered it's due to parcel. parcel is behind the rendering of this jsx
// it got transpiled before reaching the js engine-    babel is working....
